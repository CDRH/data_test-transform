            <milestone unit="horbar"/>

            <p>I <hi rend="small-caps">am</hi> advised by my publishers that this book is to be
               included in their catalogue of humorous publications,<anchor
                  xml:id="intro.note.summer08.publication"/> and this friendly warning gives me an
               opportunity to say that however humorous it may be in effect, its intention is
               perfectly serious;<anchor xml:id="intro.note.summer08.humorism"/> and, even if it
               were otherwise, it seems to me that a volume written wholly in dialect must have its
               solemn, not to say melancholy, features.<anchor xml:id="intro.note.summer08.dialect"
               /> With respect to the Folk-Lore series, my purpose has been to preserve the legends
               themselves in their original simplicity,<anchor xml:id="intro.note.summer08.purpose"
               /> and to wed them permanently to the quaint dialect<anchor
                  xml:id="intro.note.dialect.begin"/>—if, indeed, it can be called a dialect—<anchor
                  xml:id="intro.note.dialect.end"/>through the medium of which they have become a
               part of the domestic history of every Southern family; and I have endeavored to give
               to the whole a genuine flavor of the old plantation.</p>

            <p>Each legend has its variants, but in every instance I have retained that particular
               version which seemed to me to be the most characteristic, and have given it without
               embellishment and without exaggeration. The dialect, it will be observed, is wholly
               different from that of the Hon. Pompey Smash and his literary descendants, and
               different <pb facs="har1880.2007.001.0012.jpg"/>
               <fw type="pag" place="margintop">4</fw>
               <fw type="head" place="margincenter">INTRODUCTION.</fw>also from the intolerable
               misrepresentations of the minstrel stage, but it is at least phonetically
                  genuine.<anchor xml:id="intro.note.pompey"/><anchor
                  xml:id="intro.note.summer08.pompey"/><anchor xml:id="intro.note.summer08.minstrel"
               /> Nevertheless, if the language of Uncle Remus fails to give vivid hints of the
               really poetic imagination of the negro; if it fails to embody the quaint and homely
               humor which was his most prominent characteristic; if it does not suggest a certain
               picturesque sensitiveness—a curious exaltation of mind and temperament not to be
               defined by words—then I have reproduced the form of the dialect merely, and not the
               essence, and my attempt may be accounted a failure. At any rate, I trust I have been
               successful in presenting what must be, at least to a large portion of American
               readers, a new and by no means unattractive phase of negro character—a phase which
               may be considered a curiously sympathetic supplement to Mrs. Stowe's wonderful
               defense of slavery as it existed in the South.<anchor xml:id="intro.note.stowe"
                  /><anchor xml:id="intro.note.summer08.uncletom"/><anchor
                  xml:id="intro.note.summer08.uncletom.stageshows"/> Mrs. Stowe, let me hasten to
               say, attacked the possibilities of slavery with all the eloquence of genius; but the
               same genius painted the portrait of the Southern slave-owner, and defended him.</p>

            <p>A number of the plantation legends originally appeared in the columns of a daily
               newspaper—"The Atlanta Constitution"<anchor xml:id="intro.note.ajc"/><anchor
                  xml:id="intro.note.summer08.ajc"/>—and in that shape they attracted the attention
               of various gentlemen who were kind enough to suggest that they would prove to be
               valuable contributions to myth-literature. It is but fair to say that ethnological
               considerations formed no part of the undertaking which has resulted in the
               publication of this volume. Professor J. W. Powell<anchor xml:id="intro.note.powell"
                  /><anchor xml:id="intro.note.summer08.powell"/>, of the Smithsonian Institution,
               who is engaged in an investigation of the mythology of the North American Indians,
                  <pb facs="har1880.2007.001.0013.jpg"/>
               <fw type="head" place="margincenter">INTRODUCTION.</fw>
               <fw type="pag" place="margintop">5</fw> informs me that some of Uncle Remus's stories
               appear in a number of different languages, and in various modified forms, among the
               Indians; and he is of the opinion that they are borrowed by the negroes from the
               red-men. But this, to say the least, is extremely doubtful, since another
               investigator (Mr. Herbert H. Smith<anchor xml:id="intro.note.smith"/><anchor
                  xml:id="intro.note.summer08.smith"/>, author of "Brazil and the Amazons") has met
               with some of these stories among tribes of South American Indians, and one in
               particular he has traced to India, and as far east as Siam. Mr. Smith has been kind
               enough to send me the proof-sheets of his chapter on "The Myths and Folk-Lore of the
               Amazonian Indians," in which he reproduces some of the stories which he gathered
               while exploring the Amazons.</p>

            <p>In the first of his series, a tortoise falls from a tree upon the head of a jaguar
               and kills him; in one of Uncle Remus's stories, the terrapin falls from a shelf in
               Miss Meadows's house and stuns the fox, so that the latter fails to catch the rabbit.
               In the next, a jaguar catches a tortoise by the hind-leg as he is disappearing in his
               hole; but the tortoise convinces him he is holding a root, and so escapes; Uncle
               Remus tells how the fox endeavored to drown the terrapin, but turned him loose
               because the terrapin declared his tail to be only a stump-root.<anchor
                  xml:id="intro.note.summer08.terrapin"/> Mr. Smith also gives the story of how the
               tortoise outran the deer, which is identical as to incident with Uncle Remus's story
               of how Brer Tarrypin outran Brer Rabbit. Then there is the story of how the tortoise
               pretended that he was stronger than the tapir<anchor xml:id="intro.note.tapir"
                  /><anchor xml:id="intro.note.summer08.tapir"/>. He tells the latter he can drag
               him into the sea, but the tapir retorts that he will pull the tortoise into the
               forest and kill <pb facs="har1880.2007.001.0014.jpg"/>
               <fw type="pag" place="margintop">6</fw>
               <fw type="head" place="margincenter">INTRODUCTION.</fw>him besides. The tortoise
               thereupon gets a vine-stem, ties one end around the body of the tapir, and goes to
               the sea, where he ties the other end to the tail of a whale. He then goes into the
               wood, midway between them both, and gives the vine a shake as a signal for the
               pulling to begin. The struggle between the whale and tapir goes on until each thinks
               the tortoise is the strongest of animals. Compare this with the story of the
               terrapin's contest with the bear, in which Miss Meadows's bed-cord is used instead of
               a vine-stem. One of the most characteristic of Uncle Remus's stories is that in which
               the rabbit proves to Miss Meadows and the girls that the fox is his riding-horse.
               This is almost identical with a story quoted by Mr. Smith, where the jaguar is about
               to marry the deer's daughter. The cotia<anchor xml:id="intro.note.cotia"/><anchor
                  xml:id="intro.note.summer08.agouti"/>—a species of rodent—is also in love with
               her, and he tells the deer that he can make a riding-horse of the jaguar. <q
                  who="#deer">"Well,"</q> says the deer, <q who="#deer">"if you can make the jaguar
                  carry you, you shall have my daughter."</q> Thereupon the story proceeds pretty
               much as Uncle Remus tells it of the fox and rabbit. The cotia finally jumps from the
               jaguar and takes refuge in a hole, where an owl is set to watch him, but he flings
               sand in the owl's eyes and escapes. In another story given by Mr. Smith, the cotia is
               very thirsty, and, seeing a man coming with a jar on his head, lies down in the road
               in front of him, and repeats this until the man puts down his jar to go back after
               all the dead cotias he has seen. This is almost identical with Uncle Remus's story of
               how the rabbit robbed the fox of his game. In a story from Upper Egypt, a fox lies
               down in <pb facs="har1880.2007.001.0015.jpg"/>
               <fw type="head" place="margincenter">INTRODUCTION.</fw>
               <fw type="pag" place="margintop">7</fw>the road in front of a man who is carrying
               fowls to market, and finally succeeds in securing them.</p>

            <p>This similarity extends to almost every story quoted by Mr. Smith, and some are so
               nearly identical as to point unmistakably to a common origin; but when and where?
               When did the negro or the North American Indian ever come in contact with the tribes
               of South America? Upon this point the author of "Brazil and the Amazons," who is
               engaged in making a critical and comparative study of these myth-stories, writes:</p>

            <q>
               <p>"I am not prepared to form a theory about these stories. There can be no doubt
                  that some of them, found among the negroes and the Indians, had a common origin.
                  The most natural solution would be to suppose that they originated in Africa, and
                  were carried to South America by the negro slaves. They are certainly found among
                  the Red Negroes<anchor xml:id="intro.note.red_negroes"/><anchor
                     xml:id="intro.note.summer08.rednegro"/>; but, unfortunately for the African
                  theory, it is equally certain that they are told by savage Indians of the Amazons
                  Valley, away up on the Tapajos, Red Negro, and Tapurá.<anchor
                     xml:id="intro.note.summer08.rivers"/> These Indians hardly ever see a negro,
                  and their languages are very distinct from the broken Portuguese spoken by the
                  slaves. The form of the stories, as recounted in the Tupi and Mundurucú languages,

               <p>"One thing is certain. The animal stories told by the negroes in our Southern

                  there, or with the Arabs, or Egyptians, or with yet more ancient nations, must
                  still be an open question. Whether the Indians got them from the negroes or from
                  some earlier source is equally uncertain. We have seen enough to know that a very

            <p>The story of the Rabbit and the Fox, as told by the Southern negroes, is artistically
               dramatic in this: it progresses in an orderly way from a beginning to a well-defined
               conclusion, and is full of striking episodes that suggest the culmination. It seems
               to me to be to a certain extent allegorical, albeit such an interpretation may be
                  unreasonable.<anchor xml:id="intro.note.summer08.allegory"/> At least it is a
               fable thoroughly characteristic of the negro; and it needs no scientific
               investigation to show why he selects as his hero the weakest and most harmless of all
               animals, and brings him out victorious in contests with the bear, the wolf, and the
               fox. It is not virtue that triumphs, but helplessness; it is not malice, but
               mischievousness. It would be presumptive in me to offer an opinion as to the <pb

               myth-stories; but, if ethnologists should discover that they did not originate with
               the African, the proof to that effect should be accompanied with a good deal of
               persuasive eloquence.</p>

            <p>Curiously enough, I have found few negroes who will acknowledge to a stranger that
               they know anything of these legends; and yet to relate one of the stories is the
               surest road to their confidence and esteem. In this way, and in this way only, I have
               been enabled to collect and verify the folk-lore included in this volume. There is an
               anecdote about the Irishman and the rabbit which a number of negroes have told to me
               with great unction, and which is both funny and characteristic, though I will not
               undertake to say that it has its origin with the blacks.<anchor
                  xml:id="intro.note.summer08.irish"/> One day an Irishman who had heard people
               talking about "mares' nests"<anchor xml:id="intro.note.mares_nest"/> was going along
               the big road—it is always the big road in contradistinction to neighborhood paths and
               by-paths, called in the vernacular "nigh-cuts"—when he came to a
                  pumpkin-patch.<anchor xml:id="intro.note.summer08.maresnest"/> The Irishman had
               never seen any of this fruit before, and he at once concluded that he had discovered
               a veritable mare's nest. Making the most of his opportunity, he gathered one of the
               pumpkins in his arms and went on his way. A pumpkin is an exceedingly awkward thing
               to carry, and the Irishman had not gone far before he made a misstep, and stumbled.
               The pumpkin fell to the ground, rolled down the hill into a "brush-heap," and,
               striking against a stump, was broken. The story continues in the dialect: <choice>

               country districts, the dialect of the legends has nearly disappeared. I am perfectly

               embodied here for the purpose of presenting a phase of negro character wholly
               distinct from that which I have endeavored to preserve in the legends. Only in this
               shape, and with all the local allusions, would it be possible to adequately represent
               the shrewd observations, the curious retorts, the homely thrusts, the quaint
               comments, and the humorous philosophy of the race of which Uncle Remus is a type.</p>

            <p>If the reader not familiar with plantation life will imagine that the myth-stories of
               Uncle Remus are told night after night to a little boy by an old negro who appears to
               be venerable enough to have lived during the period which he describes—who has
               nothing but pleasant memories of the discipline of slavery—and who has all the
               prejudices of caste and pride of family that were the natural results of the system;
               if the reader can imagine all this, he will find little difficulty in appreciating
               and sympathizing with the air of affectionate superiority which Uncle Remus assumes
               as he proceeds to unfold the mysteries of plantation lore to a little child who is a
               product of that practical reconstruction which has been going on to some extent since
               the war in spite of the politicians.<anchor xml:id="intro.note.reconstruction"/>
               Uncle Remus describes that reconstruction in his "Story of the War," and I may as
               well add here for the benefit of the curious that that story is almost literally
               true.</p>

               <p> When the little boy ran in to see Uncle Remus the night after he had told him of
                  the awful fate of Brer Wolf, the only response to his greeting was:</p>

               <p>
                  <q who="#uncle_remus">"I-doom-er-ker-kum-mer-ker!"</q>

               <p>No explanation could convey an adequate idea of the intonation and pronunciation
                  which Uncle Remus brought to bear upon this wonderful word. Those who can recall
                  to mind the peculiar gurgling, jerking, liquid sound made by pouring water from a
                  large jug, or the sound produced by throwing several stones in rapid succession
                  into a pond of deep water, may be able to form a very faint idea of the sound, but
                  it can not be reproduced in print. The little boy was astonished.</p>

                     but an alligator was substituted for the fox, and a little boy for the rabbit.
                     There is another version in which the impertinent gosling goes to tell the fox
                     something her mother has said, and is caught; and there may be other versions.
                     I have adhered to the middle Georgia version, which is characteristic enough.
                     It may be well to state that there are different versions of all the
                     stories—the shrewd narrators of the mythology of the old plantation adapting themselves with ready tact to the years, tastes, and expectations of their

               <p>The little boy made no further attempt to justify his conduct. He was a very wise
                  little boy, and he knew that, in Uncle Remus's eyes, he had been guilty of a
                  flagrant violation of the family code. Therefore, instead of attempting to justify
                  himself, he pleaded guilty, and promised that he would never do so any more. After
                  this there was a long period of silence, broken only by the vigorous style in
                  which Uncle Remus puffed away at his pipe. This was the invariable result.
                  Whenever the old man had occasion to reprimand the little boy—and the occasions
                  were frequent—he would relapse into a dignified but stubborn silence. Presently
                  the youngster drew forth from his pocket a long piece of candle. The sharp eyes of
                  the old man saw it at once.</p>

               <p>The next time the little boy sought Uncle Remus out, he found the old man
                  unusually cheerful and good-humored. His rheumatism had ceased to trouble him, and
                  he was even disposed to be boisterous. He was singing when the little boy got near
                  the cabin, and the child paused on the outside to listen to the vigorous but
                  mellow voice of the old man, as it rose and fell with the burden of the curiously
                  plaintive song—a senseless affair so far as the words were concerned, but sung to
                  a melody almost thrilling in its sweetness:</p>

                  include even those he could not understand. Uncle Remus was finishing an
                  axe-handle, and upon these occasions it was his custom to allow the child to hold
                  one end while he applied sand-paper to the other. These relations were pretty soon

               <p>The serious tone of the old man caused the little boy to open his eyes. The moon,
                  just at its full, cast long, vague, wavering shadows in front of the cabin. A
                  colony of tree-frogs somewhere in the distance were treating their neighbors to a
                  serenade, but to the little boy it sounded like a chorus of lost and
                  long-forgotten whistlers. The sound was wherever the imagination chose to locate
                  it—to the right, to the left, in the air, on the ground, far away or near at hand,
                  but always dim and always indistinct. Something in Uncle Remus's tone exactly
                  fitted all these surroundings, and the child nestled closer to the old man.</p>

               <p>One night, while the little boy was watching Uncle Remus twisting and waxing some
                  shoe-thread, he made what appeared to him to be a very curious discovery. He
                  discovered that the palms of the old man's hands were as white as his own, and the
                  fact was such a source of wonder that he at last made it the subject of remark.
                  The response of Uncle Remus led to the earnest recital of a piece of unwritten
                  history that must prove interesting to ethnologists.</p>

               <p>The little boy laughed. He thought Uncle Remus was making him the victim of one of
                  his jokes; but the youngster was never more mistaken. The old man was serious.
                  Nevertheless, he failed to rebuke the ill-timed mirth of the child, appearing to
                  be altogether engrossed in his work. After a while he resumed:</p>

            <p>When Miss Theodosia Huntingdon, of Burlington, Vermont, concluded to come South in
               1870, she was moved by three considerations. In the first place, her brother, John
               Huntingdon, had become a citizen of Georgia—having astonished his acquaintances by
               marrying a young lady, the male members of whose family had achieved considerable
               distinction in the Confederate army; in the second place, she was anxious to explore
               a region which she almost unconsciously pictured to herself as remote and
               semi-barbarous; and, in the third place, her friends had persuaded her that to some
               extent she was an invalid. It was in vain that she argued with herself as to the
               propriety of undertaking the journey alone and unprotected, and she finally put an
               end to inward and outward doubts by informing herself and her friends, including John
               Huntingdon, her brother, who was practicing law in Atlanta, that she had decided to
               visit the South.</p>

            <p>When, therefore, on the 12th of October, 1870—the date is duly recorded in one of
               Miss Theodosia's letters—she alighted from the cars in Atlanta, in the midst of a
               great crowd, she fully expected to find her brother waiting to <pb

               <fw type="head" place="margincenter">A STORY OF THE WAR.</fw> receive her. The bells
               of several locomotives were ringing, a number of trains were moving in and out, and
               the porters and baggage-men were screaming and bawling to such an extent that for
               several moments Miss Huntingdon was considerably confused; so much so that she paused
               in the hope that her brother would suddenly appear and rescue her from the smoke, and
               dust, and din. At that moment some one touched her on the arm, and she heard a
               strong, half-confident, half-apologetic voice exclaim:</p>

            <p>
               <q who="#uncle_remus">
                  <choice>
                     <orig type="eye-dialect">"Ain't dish yer Miss Doshy?"</orig>
                     <reg>"Ain't this here Miss Doshy?"</reg>
                  </choice>
               </q>
            </p>

            <p>Turning, Miss Theodosia saw at her side a tall, gray-haired negro. Elaborating the
               incident afterward to her friends, she was pleased to say that the appearance of the
               old man was somewhat picturesque. He stood towering above her, his hat in one hand, a
               carriage-whip in the other, and an expectant smile lighting up his rugged face. She
               remembered a name her brother had often used in his letters, and, with a woman's
               tact, she held out her hand, and said:</p>

            <p>The next moment Uncle Remus was elbowing his way unceremoniously through the crowd,
               and in a very short time, seated in the carriage driven by the old man, Miss <choice>

               </choice> was whirling through the streets of Atlanta in the direction of her
               brother's home. She took advantage of the opportunity to study the old negro's face
               closely, her natural curiosity considerably sharpened by a knowledge of the fact that
               Uncle Remus had played an important part in her brother's history. The result of her
               observation must have been satisfactory, for presently she laughed, and said:</p>

               <q who="#theodosia_huntingdon">"Uncle Remus, you haven't told me how you knew me in
                  that great crowd."</q>
            </p>

            <p>The old man chuckled, and gave the horses a gentle rap with the whip.</p>

            <p>This was Miss Theodosia's introduction to Uncle Remus. One Sunday afternoon, a few
               weeks after her arrival, the family were assembled in the piazza enjoying the mild
               weather. Mr. Huntingdon was reading a newspaper; his wife was crooning softly as she
               rocked the baby to sleep; and the little boy was endeavoring to show his Aunt Dosia
               the outlines of Kennesaw Mountain throngh the purple haze that hung like a
               wonderfully fashioned curtain in the sky and almost obliterated the horizon. While
               they were thus engaged, Uncle Remus came around the corner of the house, talking to
               himself.</p>

            <p>Uncle Remus shuffled around in an awkward, embarrassed way, scratched his head, and

               was painfully conscious of the fact, as she afterward admitted—that Uncle Remus spoke
               from the standpoint of a Southerner, and with the air of one who expected his hearers

               <p>The notable difference existing between the negroes in the interior of the cotton
                  States and those on the seaboard—a difference that extends to habits and opinions
                  as well as to dialect—has given rise to certain ineradicable prejudices which are
                  quick to display themselves whenever an opportunity offers. These prejudices were
                  forcibly, as well as ludicrously, illustrated in Atlanta recently. A gentleman
                  from Savannah had been spending the summer in the mountains of north Georgia, and
                  found it convenient to take along a body-servant. This body-servant was a very
                  fine specimen of the average coast negro—sleek, well-conditioned, and
                  consequential—disposed to regard with undisguised contempt everything and
                  everybody not indigenous to the rice-growing region—and he paraded around the
                  streets with quite a curious and critical air. Espying Uncle Remus languidly
                  sunning himself on a corner, the Savannah darkey approached.</p>

               <p>When Uncle Remus put in an appearance one morning recently, his friends knew he
                  had been in trouble. He had a red cotton handkerchief tied under his chin, and the
                  genial humor that usually makes his aged face its dwelling-place had given way to
                  an expression of grim melancholy. The young men about the office were inclined to
                  chaff him, but his look of sullen resignation remained unchanged.</p>

                  was going on around him, and he sighed heavily as he seated himself on the edge of
                  the trash-box in front of the office. Finally some one asked, in a sympathetic

               <p>Uncle Remus was in good humor one evening recently when he dropped casually into
                  the editorial room of "The Constitution," as has been his custom for the past year
                  or two. He had a bag slung across his shoulder, and in the bag was a jug. The
                  presence of this humble but useful vessel in Uncle Remus's bag was made the
                  occasion for several suggestive jokes at his expense by the members of the staff,
                  but the old man's good humor was proof against all insinuations.</p>

               <p>Uncle Remus made his appearance recently with his right arm in a sling and his
                  hand bandaged to that extent that it looked like the stick made to accompany the
                  Centennial bass-drum. The old man evidently expected an attack all around, for he
                  was unusually quiet, and fumbled in his pockets in an embarrassed manner. He was
                  not mistaken. The agricultural editor was the first to open fire:</p>

               </p>

               <p>This fine moral sentiment, which was altogether an impromptu utterance, and which
                  was delivered with the air of one who addresses a vast but invisible audience of
                  young ladies in white dresses and blue sashes, seemed to add to the embarrassment
                  of Uncle Remus, and at the same time to make an explanation necessary.</p>

            <p>"The notion has somehow got abroad that the scientific study of the Bible is
               inconsistent with the most tender reverence for its contents, or with their
               persistent fascination. But the reverence of Mr. Heilprin for the subject-matter of
               his criticism could hardly be surpassed; and, that it has not lost its power to
               interest and charm, his book itself is ample evidence, which will be reënforced by
               the experience of every intelligent reader of its too brief contents."—<hi

               Collected and translated by J. de Finod. One vol., 16mo. Cloth. Price, $1.00.</p>

            <p>This work consists of a collection of wise and brilliant sayings from French writers,

            <p>"The book is a charming one to take up for an idle moment during the warm weather,

               gentlemen. Some of its sayings about the first mentioned would no doubt occasion
               lively discussion, but that is just what is needed to dispel the often wellnigh
               intolerable languor of a summer afternoon."—<hi rend="italics">Boston Courier.</hi>
