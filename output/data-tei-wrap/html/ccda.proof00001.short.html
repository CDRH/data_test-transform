            Though the windows of the chamber were wide open, and the
            muslin curtains looped back, not a breath of air was stirring, Only the shrill chirp of
            the cicanda and the muffled croaking of the frogs in some distant marsh broke the night
            silence. The heavy scent of magnolias, overpowering even the strong smell of drugs in
            the sick-room, suggested death and funeral wreaths, sorrow and tears, the long home, the
            last sleep<span data-tei-e="subst" data-tei-a-hand-medium="blue pencil" data-tei-a-hand-resp="cwc" title="Chesnutt, Charles W. (Charles Waddell), 1858-1932">

          <p data-tei-e="p">Major Carteret, though dressed in brown linen, had thrown off his coat for greater
            comfort. The stifling heat, in spite of the palm-leaf fan which he plied mechanically,
            was scarcely less oppressive than his own thoughts. Long ago, while yet a mere boy in
            years, he had come back <span data-tei-e="unclear" data-tei-a-reason="ripped">from</span> Appomattox, to find his family, one of the oldest and
            proudest in the State, <span data-tei-e="pb"></span>
            <span data-tei-e="fw">2 THE MARROW OF TRADITION</span> hopelessly impoverished by the war, even their
            ancestral home swallowed up in the common ruin. His elder brother had sacrificed his
            life on the bloody altar of the lost cause, and his father, broken and chagrined, died
            not many years later, leaving the major the last of his line. He had tried in various
            pursuits to gain a foothold in the new life, but with indifferent success until he won
            the hand of Olivia Merkell, whom he had seen grow from a small girl to glorious
            womanhood. With her money he had founded the Morning Chronicle, which he had made the
            leading organ of his party and the most influential paper in the State. The fine old
            house in which they lived was hers. In this very room he had first drawn the breath of
            life; it had been their nuptial chamber; and here, too, within a few hours, she might
            die, for it seemed impossible that one could long endure such frightful agony and
            live.</p>
