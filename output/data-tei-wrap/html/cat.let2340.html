                        Last week the moon rose further and further north every night, first over
                        the tip of fishhead, and finally right in front of our door—came up out of
                        the water like a battered old copper kettle as it grew more and more
                        lop–sided. It made such a bright, narrow path right to the foot of our cliff
                        that one was tempted to walk across it. The weather has been wonderful—blue
                        and gold every day, with good rains at night.</p>

                        it, we can make it come true. Next time it must be in August, when all the

                        to arrive. The morning you left we got up early and waited on the shore, but
                        we couldn't even see the boat. I wish <span data-tei-e="persName" data-tei-a-target="psn0200">your

                        could have come on by airplane and dropped down on us while you were here.
